        <hgroup><p>“Same quilt in life, same grave in death”<br>
        What we have isn’t to be held,<br>
        But lowered.</p>

        <p>The underworld could be something new for us<br>
        To watch,<br>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;   I watch </p>

        <p>As you ascend instead.</p>

        <p>I wasn’t crying,<br>
        I was staring and forgot to blink.<br></p>
        <p> The golden sky, the morning birds, <br>
        it all took you <br>
        from me. And our pit of hell.</p>

        <p>Why do I have nothing again,<br>
        don't I always have you?<br>
        Where have you<br>
        gone.</p>

        <p> Did they erect temples for you?<br>
        I surely couldn’t<br>
        bring myself to sculpt that calm satisfaction, look in your eyes<br>
        of porcelain</p>

        <p> A look knowing<br>
        so confidently knowing that I was yours<br>
        I belonged to you<br>
        belong to you still,<br>
        Tying a knot around every good deed</p>

        <p> The door you hold open,<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; &ensp;  (thanks)<br>
        and maybe I could join you,<br>
        up above.</p>

        <p> But I chose something new for us</p>

        <p> I was loving,<br>
        giving my essence,<br>
        dissecting myself before you,<br>
        burying myself within you.<br>
        We have the same grave in death, now<br>
        But that statue wasn’t of me,</p>

        <p id="bigindent"> &ensp; was it?</p> </hgroup>

        <br>
        <rb><p> But then:&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<br>
        From my tomb of us,&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<br>
        From my personal ‘change of scenery’&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <br>
        Which you were too good for, I noticed&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;</p>

        <p> you would descend from gods,&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<br>
        Not to my depths&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<br>
        But the surface&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;</p>

        <p> Where we built everything we had&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<br>
        And how all of it is nothing without you.&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;</p>

        <p> You would swoop down, to the temple of you&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<br>
        There was no calming look in your eyes this time,&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<br>
        only a vision&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;</p>

        <p>Trying to remember the shape of my back&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<br>
        Forming the beauty mark behind my left ear&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<br>
        Caressing, that is chiseled from stone. &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;</p></rb>

        <br>
        <hgroup> <p> they erect temples for you?<br>
        I surely couldn’t </p></hgroup>

        <br>
        <rb> <p> But I watched you.&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<br>
        only when I was back in your view, sharing a monument,&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<br>
        beside you eternally&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<br>
        did the look in your eyes resurrect.&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;</p>

        <p>The look I could never get mad at&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<br>
        The one that makes you the angel &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;</p></rb>

        <br>
        <hgroup><p>and I<br>
        a ghost. </p>

        <p>“Same quilt in life, same grave in death”</p></hgroup>

        <rb><p>And same shrine in rest &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;</p></rb>
