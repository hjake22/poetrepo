this code takes the input of a poem via txt file, assuming the first line is its title and the second line features its author.
the code then returns the line count, stanza count, and even calculates the average lines per stanza for you!

an example of how to run the code would be to enter the terminal and write:
python3 poemregex.py inthecornerapartment.txt
