in the corner apartment
by Jake Hoffman 

and I would cherish you
and you may hide me
because at least I know I belong
to your corner apartment.
the one without window treatments.

and we never covered up
except for the sweatshirt you gave
to dampen my heart
that beats too loud
when I’m the light sleeper.

and I’m sensitive to light 
so without window treatments
you silently shield my sunrise
and your arm glistens, I’m sure
as you listen to my steady breath.

and I like that we can have lives
outside just each other
but at least we sleep together.
you wake for your meeting at eight
with me snoring on your left arm

and you slice quietly, not to wake me
you bite your lip, not to wake me
you cut the sleeve of your shirt, not to wake me
and alongside it, your bone, blood and muscle
the amputated arm shields my eyes, cushions my head

and you head to work
and as you gush, it glistens
